# AY-8910-to-AY-8912-adapter
PCB to adapt an AY-3-8912 footprint to an AY-3-8910 chip

This project was done for my Superfo Harlequin 128 build because the cost of an AY-3-8912 is substantially more
than an AY-3-8910 despite the latter being much more functional. Even taking into account PCB manafacturing costs.
